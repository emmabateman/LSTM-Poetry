The 17-Year-Old & the Gay Bar
this gin-heavy heaven, blessed ground to think gay & mean we.
 bless the fake id & the bouncer who knew
 this need to be needed, to belong, to know how
 a man taste full on vodka & free of sin. i know not which god to pray to.
 i look to christ, i look to every mouth on the dance floor, i order
 a whiskey coke, name it the blood of my new savior. he is just.
 he begs me to dance, to marvel men with the
                                                                                    dash
 of hips i brought, he deems my mouth in some stranger’s mouth necessary.
 bless that man’s mouth, the song we sway sloppy to, the beat, the bridge, the length
 of his hand on my thigh & back & i know not which country i am of.
 i want to live on his tongue, build a home of gospel & gayety
 i want to raise a city behind his teeth for all boys of choirs & closets to refuge in.
 i want my new god to look at the mecca i built him & call it damn good
 or maybe i’m just tipsy & free for the first time, willing to worship anything i can taste.
