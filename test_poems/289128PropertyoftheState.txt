#289-128 Property of the State
: .or. this malus thing never to be confused with justice

 nothing symbolic. OK. dark is dark—
    cage is cage. hunted & hunter are both

 in the literal. make believe & what ifs
    do not exist: a lie. nothing cryptic here.

 OK. rape is rape. prey must pray. no
    minute in the future safe from quiet

 insertions of a shank in masking tape.
    OK. nothing here infinite: only time

 is constant to the merciful & merciless—
    there are no allegories to hide behind.

he slit his wrists means he slit his fuckin wrist 

 OK? there is a cell with one window
    just before day. dawn’s early demise

 magnifies a dull metal toilet. the cool
    water cooling two can sodas. each

 wall a slab of soft gray cinderblock, no
    posters featuring eroticized women

 with an exclusive in black tail. OK.
    the wall that slits the light does not

 reveal nothing new, ever. the exposé
    the changing same: always a holding.

 one window offers a gateway. my face
    pressed against the window & time

 rules this empire. OK. the mind held
    hostage by time. mind & body

 conjoined twins. the other wall holds
    a frame. the frame holds a metal door

 to contain utter disbelief. of the visible:
    walls are gray not like summer

 but darker—yes. there is darkness. OK—
