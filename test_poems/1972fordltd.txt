1972 ford ltd
a harvest gold & avocado green leisure suit with fm radio, it was their,
 well, daddy’s, mansion, his james brown conk cool, his funky country
 on radials, power windows and doors a working class music. here is
 our block-long plush, envy of uncles and teenage dolemite dreams. a
 ms. cleopatra jones ride, showing yankees, john denver, the hippie nation
 and everyone except texas the middle finger. kept the 25 gallon tank on
 full. we drove to kentucky for my sister’s wedding on hot back roads, no
 cracker corn farmer’s rifle loud enough to make daddy use a map.
