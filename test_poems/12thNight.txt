12th Night
Swaggering like rain like rain like rain
         and swaggering the day the day the day
 and swaggering it raineth all day all day
       and swaggering I claimed I claimed
 I claimed and swaggering the dog the dog the dog
       and swaggering anew anew anew and swaggering
      for you for you for you and swaggering I felt
 I felt I felt and swaggering at night in spite in spite
       and swaggering inside I died I died
